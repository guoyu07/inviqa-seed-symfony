# Hobo project seed (Symfony specific)

This repository contains the common configuration, structure and tooling necessary to kickstart a Symfony project in a consistent manner.

It is designed for use with the "hobo seed plant" command and while cloning it directly as a base to start from, you'll be missing out hobo being able to populate some placeholders for you.

## Goals

The primary goals of this template are to speed up VM related sprint zero tasks, increase predictability of project structure and increase the robustness of project VMs.
